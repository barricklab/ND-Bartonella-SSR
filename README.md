Each folder is a step in the analysis.

It may contain a Conda environment, bash command file, and input/output data files needed to carry out that step of the analysis. Usually, you will need to copy/move the output from one folder to the next. 

Illumina sequencing reads used as input to create the assemblies of the 38 _Bartonella_ isolates from the Negev Desert sand dunes are available for download from the NCBI SRA ([PRJNA1061316](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1061316/)).
